BUGS to SAS
========================================================

This serves as an attempt to document similar syntax used in BUGS and SAS. General categories are separated into (1) common statistical distributions, (2) establishing the Markov chain, (3) plotting MCMC results, and (4) working with the posterior samples.

Much of the BUGS code relies on the [R2WinBUGS](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R2WinBUGS/index.html) and/or [BRugs](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BRugs/index.html) packages in R.

Any additions, corrections, and/or suggested improvements are encouraged and appreciated. Send an [email](mailto:russellm@umn.edu).
